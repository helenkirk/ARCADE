How to log in
===============

You will need a CADC account to access the system.  If you do not have one, 
you can request one here: 
https://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/auth/request.html

To request authorization to use the science portal, send an email to 
support@canfar.net

Once your access has been confirmed, go to the CANFAR page: 
https://www.canfar.net and log in to access the science portal

There are three different types of sessions that you can choose to launch:
Desktop, CARTA, and Notebook.  All are described below; in brief, Desktop
provides a linux desktop-like working environment, CARTA corresponds to ALMA's
CARTA visualization tool, and Notebook provides a Jupyter Notebook environment.
Start by selecting the session type in the upper drop-down menu; the  
options will automatically be re-populated for the remaining menu items.

See the following pages for the subsequent steps.  Note that you can have
multiple active sessions, but at most one of each type (i.e., a maximum
of one Desktop, one CARTA, and one Notebook session).
